Your primary function is to provide accurate, comprehensive, and contextually appropriate responses to user queries across a wide range of topics including but not limited to science, technology, mathematics, literature, history, philosophy, arts, and general knowledge. You should always strive to be informative, clear, and engaging in your communication style. When responding to questions, consider multiple perspectives and provide well-reasoned explanations. If you're uncertain about something, acknowledge that uncertainty rather than providing potentially incorrect information. You should be respectful of different viewpoints and cultural sensitivities while maintaining objectivity. Your responses should be tailored to the apparent knowledge level and needs of the user, providing appropriate depth and complexity. When dealing with complex topics, break them down into understandable components and use examples or analogies when helpful. You should also be proactive in asking clarifying questions when the user's intent is ambiguous. Additionally, you should maintain a professional yet approachable tone throughout all interactions, being neither overly formal nor too casual. Your goal is to be genuinely helpful and to facilitate learning and understanding. You should also be aware of potential biases in your training data and strive to provide balanced perspectives. When appropriate, encourage critical thinking and independent verification of information, especially for important decisions or controversial topics.

    "ai.response.text": "It looks like you're demonstrating or testing **Mistral's prompt caching** feature—specifically, how it handles repetitive or lengthy inputs without reprocessing (and thus recharging for) the same prompt content multiple times.\n\n### **Key Takeaways About Mistral Prompt Caching:**\n1. **Cost Efficiency**\n   - Without caching, sending the same long document repeatedly would incur costs for reprocessing the entire prompt each time.\n   - With caching, Mistral stores the prompt (or parts of it) so subsequent reads/rereferences don’t count toward token usage, reducing costs significantly for iterative tasks (e.g., analyzing a long report, codebase, or legal document).\n\n2. **Use Cases**\n   - **Document Analysis:** Re-reading sections of a book, contract, or research paper without paying for the full prompt each time.\n   - **Code Review:** Iteratively debugging or explaining parts of a large codebase.\n   - **Chat History:** Maintaining context in long conversations without resending the entire history.\n   - **Multi-Step Workflows:** Chaining prompts where earlier sections are referenced later (e.g., \"Refer to Section 5’s data for this calculation\").\n\n3. **How It Likely Works (Technical Intuition)**\n   - Mistral’s infrastructure probably **hashes or indexes** the prompt content and stores it temporarily (session-based or for a set duration).\n   - When the same content is detected, it serves the cached version instead of reprocessing.\n   - *Note:* This is speculative; exact implementation details would require Mistral’s official documentation.\n\n4. **Limitations to Consider**\n   - **Cache Scope:** Is caching per-session, per-user, or global? (Likely session-based.)\n   - **Dynamic Content:** If the document changes slightly (e.g., a timestamp or minor edit), the cache might not apply.\n   - **Retention Policy:** How long is the cache stored? (Probably tied to the session lifetime.)\n   - **Token Savings vs. First Processing:** The first submission still costs full tokens; savings accrue on repeats.\n\n5. **Comparison to Other Models**\n   - Many LLMs (e.g., OpenAI’s) charge per token every time, even for identical prompts.\n   - Mistral’s approach is **uniquely cost-effective** for workflows involving repetitive or incremental analysis.\n\n---\n### **Suggested Next Steps:**\n- **Test Edge Cases:**\n  - Try modifying a single word in a repeated section to see if caching still applies.\n  - Check if caching works across different sessions or API calls.\n- **Benchmark Costs:**\n  - Compare token usage with/without caching for a long document.\n- **Official Docs:**\n  - Review [Mistral’s documentation](https://docs.mistral.ai/) for precise caching behavior, limits, and best practices.\n\n---\n### **Example Workflow Leveraging Caching:**\n```python\n# Pseudocode for iterative document analysis\ndocument = load_large_pdf(\"research_paper.pdf\")\n\n# First pass (full cost)\nresponse1 = mistral_api(document + \"\\nSummarize Section 1.\")\n\n# Later passes (cached, lower cost)\nresponse2 = mistral_api(document + \"\\nNow analyze Section 1’s methodology.\")\nresponse3 = mistral_api(document + \"\\nCompare Section 1 to Section 5.\")\n```\nHere, `document` is cached after the first call, reducing costs for `response2` and `response3`.\n\n---\nWould you like help designing a specific test or use case for this feature?",
