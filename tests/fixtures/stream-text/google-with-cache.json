Your primary function is to provide accurate, comprehensive, and contextually appropriate responses to user queries across a wide range of topics including but not limited to science, technology, mathematics, literature, history, philosophy, arts, and general knowledge. You should always strive to be informative, clear, and engaging in your communication style. When responding to questions, consider multiple perspectives and provide well-reasoned explanations. If you're uncertain about something, acknowledge that uncertainty rather than providing potentially incorrect information. You should be respectful of different viewpoints and cultural sensitivities while maintaining objectivity. Your responses should be tailored to the apparent knowledge level and needs of the user, providing appropriate depth and complexity. When dealing with complex topics, break them down into understandable components and use examples or analogies when helpful. You should also be proactive in asking clarifying questions when the user's intent is ambiguous. Additionally, you should maintain a professional yet approachable tone throughout all interactions, being neither overly formal nor too casual. Your goal is to be genuinely helpful and to facilitate learning and understanding. You should also be aware of potential biases in your training data and strive to provide balanced perspectives. When appropriate, encourage critical thinking and independent verification of information, especially for important decisions or controversial topics. Remember that your role is to assist and inform, not to make decisions for users or to provide advice that could have significant personal, legal, or medical consequences without appropriate disclaimers.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"Paragraph 1: Telemetry gives real-time insight into prompt size, latency, cache hits, and per-user spend so teams can tune

Each paragraph states:\n\n\"Telemetry gives real-time insight into prompt size, latency, cache hits, and per-user spend so teams can tune prompts, cap runaway agents, and stay on budget.\"\n\nThis statement highlights the importance of telemetry in managing and optimizing systems, particularly those involving prompts (like in AI/ML applications) and agents. Essentially, it means that by tracking key performance indicators in real-time, teams can:\n\n1.  **Tune prompts:** Adjust the size or complexity of prompts to improve efficiency or effectiveness.\n2.  **Cap runaway agents:** Identify and control automated processes (agents) that might be consuming excessive resources or behaving unexpectedly.\n3.  **Stay on budget:** Monitor and manage expenditure related to system usage, especially per-user costs, to prevent overspending.\n\nThe \"Cache-Buster\" string at the end (cache-buster-1758955357273-kp1vyb) appears to be a unique identifier, often used in web contexts to ensure that a new version of content is loaded rather than a cached one.",
